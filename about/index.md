If you landed on this site it was not by mistake! Thank you so much for visiting. I am just a person
Who really enjoys learning and creating things and through all of that I can grow. Throughout my life I have been able to meet several types of  people who have inspired me and I have been blessed enough to inspire others. I am not a person who has not had my share of setbacks and mistakes with that said that is why I wanted to create this site. 


I grew up with limited opportunities not the type that I was aware of. My family was always able to protect my reality and give me the best experience of my childhood as possible. One of those experiences was my first computer. It was a Macintosh Apple IIe. My Uncle gave it to me and my siblings as a present one day. I spent hours playing various games and completing homework assignments.  Computers were always a fascinating device and my family continued to refresh my computer every so often until I was able to purchase my own.

As a young adult I had the idea to pursue college education, but I was not sure what. I wanted to do game programming or video game design but I was not able to decide where to start. Some teachers said I needed to take all the math I could before I could write my first video game program. Some teachers said to focus on graphic design and work on the front of the computer.  Thinking to myself and the decision I made at the time I pursued a. Degree in visual communications for web design.


I enrolled in Briarcliffe college and I would specialize in Web Design which was an approach to web programming except without the heavy understanding of the fundamentals of computer science. 
Using Desktop publication apps such as DREAMWEAVER,  Macromedia Flash, Photoshop, and Director to help create life on the web. The school had many teachers who was interested in encouraging us to prepare as a Professional Graphic Designer. 


On the web there was various sites dedicated to entertainment such as Newgrounds.com homestar.com , diggnation, myspace, file sharing sites like lime wire and BitTorrent. These were the 
Early versions of the web that really influenced my desire for computer programming but I did not have the mindset to sit with the technology long enough. During my first enrollment in college the goal was to finish school to get a job and start becoming independent. 

My path to where I am today was not a straightforward  one it was a long winding road.  I tried many things and had many dreams that I was not fully motivate for and I would always go back to what I truly wanted in hopes to rekindle my true desire. That was to be able to be a computer programmer. After graduating with the BFA in visual communication I knew I needed more experience and more schooling. 
However that was not going to come easy I had to overcome many challenges within myself and the physical ones in the world.


Simplicity is key. It is important to not overly complex your decisions or ideas because it can lead to frustration. Consistence is also crucial because the project will not be completed in a day. You will complete the project over time with many many small contributions. As a Software developer consultant I spent many years working in this manner. Everyone contributed small methodical code contributions in the form of “commits” where the code incrementally grew with more functionally and quality. When we encountered problems in the code that made the code break, we began to debug the code and refactor the code to get the application working again.

This was known as Agile/SCRUM software development. Where  each team member had a task to fulfill and worked on communicating with the team three core questions:

- What did you do yesterday? (Share with your team your achievements from the day before?)
- What will you do today? (What do you have planned for today?)
- Are  there any blockers? (Blockers with someone else that keeps you from doing your job)


In this blog I will continue to go over these core concepts and also provide personal stories to fill in the gaps.
